# Google HashCode 2017

Team Floki's second solution to the [problem](doc/problem.pdf) from Google
HashCode 2017.

## Score

## Idea

The idea it to use the Hungarian algorithm to assign videos to caches based
on a weight. The weight represents the time it takes to get the video from a
cache.

## Running

Execute:

```
bundle exec rake solve
```

## Note

The code is messy, it was a time limited competition.
